                <h1>Before you read</h1>
                <p>
                    According to various studies, about 0,2-0,5% of the Earth’s surface is covered by roads. This means that we're already using a massive amount of real estate to roads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The function of these is to allow vehicles to drive around, but other than that the roads don't do anything.
                </p>

                <h1>Some of the benefits from solar roadways</h1>
                <p>
                    As noted in prevuis section the road we already have only have one function allowing us to drive around, but solar roads will add more functionality to the roads:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The roads are always clear of snow.</li>
                        <li>The roads are generating power from the sun and thus leaving no carbon footprint.</li>
                        <li>The roads can help navigation in bad weather and they can warn drivers about people or animals walking onto the road in great time.</li>
                        <li>The roads can make it easy to connect to the power grid and the internet.</li>
                        <li>When the solar roadways are being implenmented you as a citizen will get lower electric bills.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h1>Why you should support the idea</h1>
                <p>
                    Let's say that you choose to support the idea, what do you get out of that.<br />
                    well by supporting the idea of solar roadways you are then also supporting the idea of a green planet,<br />
                    and the protection of the climate.<br /><br />
                    Oh and you might ask what happens if you don't, well to say it the simple way,<br />
                    you are then supporting the desctruction of the climate and the planet you live on.
